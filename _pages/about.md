I'm an Italian MSc student in Economics and Finance at Sapienza University of Rome, with a strong focus on quantitative methods, statistical modeling, and machine learning. My academic background allows me to combine rigorous analytical tools with a critical understanding of economic dynamics.

My main interests lie in Quantitative Trading—where I enjoy designing, backtesting, and optimizing strategies—and in applying machine learning techniques, particularly Multilayer Perceptrons, to economic and financial problems.

I’m passionate about freediving and spending time in nature, often taking part in wilderness survival experiences. I also enjoy staying active through swimming, running, and practicing Muay Thai.
I have a strong interest in soccer — both playing and watching it.
